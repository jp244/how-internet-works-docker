        <h2>Packets & Routing</h2>
        <p>
            How is data delivered reliably? One word, routing. There is not direct dedicated line, it would be impossible
            to scale, and there’s no way to guarantee every wire/computer is working at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data must travel in a less direct fashion. The way information is transferred to one to another is not a
            fixed path. Information is broken down into smaller pieces, called a <b>packet</b>. A packet and its delivery path, or <b>route</b>, depends on traffic conditions, which may end up
            redirecting traffic to take different routes of the course of a message’s full transmission. A very large
            image may be made up of tens of billions of bits, that will be too large for one packet.
        </p>
        <p>
            A computer can quickly digest a large file and divide it into smaller packets ready for transportation. Each
            packet, like a package, will have both the address it’s going to and coming from. Traffic managers, routers,
            are in charge of redirecting packets in accordance with current networking conditions, to their final
            destination. Packets can arrive to their destination at different times, or even out of order. The fault
            tolerant characteristic keeps the internet reliable by ensuring that if one router fails, there are many
            others to pick up the slack while an outage is addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            How can you be sure that 100% of a file is transmitted? The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) manages the
            sending and receiving of all your data as packets. This is similar to a guaranteed mail service. When packets
            arrive, TCP does a full inventory to check packet health, and ensure the ordering/presence of expected
            packets. TCP will send back acknowledgments to the sender for each packet it receives, and if all packets
            are present, it will ‘sign’ for your delivery. However, if packets are not delivered, TCP will not
            acknowledge them and the sender will have to resend missing packets. Devices on the internet connect,
            communicate, and collaborate. This is because of agreed upon standards for
            how data is sent.

        to a router, and then reassmbled into the original representation on the receiving computer.</i>
