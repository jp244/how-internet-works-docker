            Data are made up of bits, essentially an on or off signal, 0 or 1. Bits are the most basic unit of data and
            are usually grouped into bytes (8 bits) which are scaled by orders of magnitude to create kilobytes,
            megabytes, gigabytes, etc. No matter the data type (video, audio, picture) it is sent around the internet
            and represented as some collection of bits. We need to machines to act as mediums for sending this data
            since systems relying on complete human translation (e.g. morse code) are inherently error prone. The main
            foundations in which machines send and receive data are some form of electricity, light, or radio waves.
        </p>
        <h4>Terms:</h4>
        <p>
            Bandwidth:  transmission capacity of a device, measured by bitrate
        </p>
        <p>
            bitrate: number of bits per second that a system can transmit
        </p>
        <p>
            latency: amount of time it takes for bit to travel from sender to receiver
        </p>
        <p>
            ethernet: cheap, can get signal loss and interference over large distances (a few hundred feet) copper cable
        <p>
            need alternative to send bits longer distances to have a global connected network, the solution is to use
            light, since it moves a lot faster than electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fiber: very fast, the signal does not degrade over long distances, a lot more expensive than ethernet and
            hard to work with
        </p>
        <p>
            how can we send things wirelessly? Introduce radios. Machines will have to translate a binary into digital
            waves in order to encode/decode data. The pro here is that we can use devices wirelessly but we can lose
            signal due to environmental factors and range. (canâ€™t get NYC radio station in LA)
        </p>
        <p>
            in the future we may use lasers from satellites, drones, or low orbiting radios

        <i>This crew is digging a path to lay out fiber cable infrastructure. The cables themselves are housed in an outer
            conduit (here, orange) to protect them from the elements. This is a very tedious and expensive process.</i>
