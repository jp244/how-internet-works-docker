        <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
        <p>
            Security on the internet is vital to its integrity. Every single day there are many cases of fraud,
            stolen credentials, and compromised secure records. Theoretically, anything connected directly or indirectly
            to the internet could be compromised. Security is a never-ending endeavor that could never be perfect,
            but it’s up to us to keep up with the newest standards, patches, and practices set fourth by security
            institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adversaries on the internet could vary from a teenager in their parent’s basement to a state-sponsored or
            terrorist organization. It’s been theorized for some time now that the next World War may in fact be a Cyber
            one, fought by interfering with power grids and other vital national infrastructure. Attackers could create
            viruses, which are similar to the name’s biological origin, in that they would infect their ‘host’ and
            spread to as many other individuals (computers) as possible. Bad actors also can use a digital army known as
            a botnet to launch as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. This kind of attack would render important
            online services useless as they would be trying to keep up with the large influx of incoming traffic. A
            phishing scam can also be employed, presented a target with a fake representation of a real service they use,
            allowing attackers to obtain login details and other important information.

        <i>This diagram shows how some adversary could control an army of computers (botnet) and command them to bombard a
            victim's server with requests. This will lead to an interruption of service for regular users.</i>
