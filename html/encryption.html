        <h2>Encryption</h2>

        <p>
            Even though the internet is an open system which uses a lot of shared infrastructure, we still exchange a
            lot of private data. Since the use of the internet is ubiquitous today, a lot of eCommerce and banking have
            taken advantage of the connected world and moved their businesses online. Sensitive information such as
            medical records, credit card numbers, banking information, communications, and passwords need to be
            exchanged privately and securely to make this possible. Data can be kept secure over computer networks by
            scrambling the plaintext information into ciphertext through a process known as encryption. The inverse of
            this, decryption, is where the ciphertext is unscrambled and converted back into plaintext.
        </p>
        <p>
            A key is a
            shared secret between the sender and receiver which is used to unlock the encryption and retrieve the
            intended payload. When the key is know to both the sender and receiver, it is called Symmetric Encryption.
            Today’s secure communications use 256-bit key, which would take thousands of super computers capable of
            trying billions of keys per second, trillions of years to try every option. In theory, it is possible to
            still guess a correct key and intercept data, but in practice this security approach is ‘good enough’ in
            that you would ‘run out the clock’ on your adversary’s computing power and/or lifetime. However, as
            technology advances and computers become faster, we must alter the size of keys to correctly scale with
            computer’s new and/or increased capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since it isn’t always practical for two parties to meet and share an agreed and mutual private key,
            Asymmetric Encryption was invented. With this type of encryption, a public key is exchanged with anyone,
            and private key is kept and only accessible to the sender and receiver. This makes it so that a secret
            message may only be decrypted by a computer with access to the relevant private key.

        <i>In this example of asymmetric key encryption, any user can encrypt a message with another's public key, but only
            the owner of the paired private key will be able to decrypt it.</i>
