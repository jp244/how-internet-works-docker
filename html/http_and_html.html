        <h2>HTTP & HTML</h2>
        <p>
            To access the web, one uses a web browser and types in the address of the page they would like to visit.
            The address of a page can also be referred to as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When you request to visit
            a page, your computer, on the order of milliseconds, asks a server to access a page. After the connection is
            established, a server responds in a language called HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP sends a GET request that
            just tells the server to return the page requested by the end user. In order to tell a web browser exactly how
            to structure a page, Hyper Text Markup Language (<b>HTML</b>) is used. HTML is represented by a series of tags and is often
            accompanied by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). <b>CSS</b> can further style a web document and enhance it with fonts,
            colors, and other layout options. Both HTML and CSS are overseen by the <b>W3C</b> (World Wide Web Consortium), which is a body
            overseen by Tim Berners Lee established to develop and maintain Web standards.

                <i>This image illustrates how a web document on the Internet could be a composition of other sources. This
                means that multiple GET requests (sometimes from different servers) may have to be completed to assemble
                    the full requested page.</i>

            When you’re interacting with a web page, you’re not always getting elements back from the web server,
            sometimes you’re sending data back as well. For example, if you’re filling out a form to sign up for an
            event, all of your inputted data will be encapsulated and sent back to the web server. The browser uses a
            method called POST to send back data. This data is usually sent back to a web server in plain text, unless
            both the web browser and web server communicate on a secure channel. Having a secure channel in place
            prevents snooping and tampering from hackers. The layer of security needed to achieve this comes from the
            Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. These protocols when combined with
            HTTP make for the HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (<b>HTTPS</b>) protocol. A web server will provide a digital
            certification to your browser, proving that it is indeed the destination you intended on reaching. Digital
            certificates are issued and verified by certificate authorities, which are trusted entities established for
            the purpose of a secure web. Today, modern browsers will warn you when you try and visit web sites that
            either have an expired certificate, or if the site is issuing one that was not expected for normal operation.

        need for HTTPS when encryption is needed.</i>
