        <h2>What is the Internet?</h2>
        <p>
            The Internet came from an experiment called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) that was a
            DoD research project. The thought was to build a communications system that would survive a nuclear attack
            and didnâ€™t have a single point of failure (centralized). The idea was to break larger pieces of
            data/messages into smaller packets and distribute them around the network to use the most efficient path to
            their intended destination (Distributed Packet-Switched Network).
        </p>
        <p>
            Independent operators and providers of Internet access assume end-to-end connectivity and dissemination of
            information. These independent networks that make up the larger Internet as a whole are responsible for
            making sure traffic flows fairly and efficiently. This idea was monumental to the fundamental ideas of doing
            science (sharing information with others).
